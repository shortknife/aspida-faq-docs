## **How Maxshot Works？**

At the heart of Maxshot AI is a **team of AI agents** working together to manage deposits, optimize yields, and keep the system running securely across multiple chains.

### **AI Agents in Action**

The protocol utilizes the DeFi Agent Framework to enable fully automated and intelligent fund management:

| **Agent** | **Role / Function** |
| --- | --- |
| **Collector Agent** | Aggregates data on APYs, liquidity, risk, and costs from various markets. |
| **Decision-Maker Agent** | Formulates yield and liquidity strategies, optimizing allocations. |
| **Executor Agent** | Executes on-chain actions, such as market deposits, withdrawals, or cross-chain transfers. |
| **AI Assistant Agent** | Provides user support, facilitates deposits via SDK/widgets, and enables third-party integrations. |
| **Keeper Agent** | Monitors protocol health, issues alerts, and triggers emergency actions when needed. |

The hybrid architecture — combining on-chain guardrails with off-chain agent workflows — ensures scalability, flexibility, and superior user experience compared to traditional DeFi. Together, these agents ensure your funds are **always in the most productive, safe position** without requiring any manual intervention.

### **Unified Ledger: One Vault Across All Chains**

Maxshot leverages a dedicated ledger chain (Base) to synchronize vault states across multiple blockchains, creating a truly omnichain DeFi experience.

- Deposits from Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, or BNB Chain all connect to the same global vault.
- OFT-standard share tokens are minted upon deposit and can move seamlessly across chains.
- This guarantees:
    
    ✅ **No double-spending**
    
    ✅ **Consistent balances**
    
    ✅ **A single source of truth** across the ecosystem
    

You don’t have to worry about fragmented liquidity or confusing chain-specific vaults. With Maxshot, it’s **one vault everywhere.**

### **Yield Allocation & Liquidity Management**

Your funds are allocated only to **whitelisted lending markets** — such as Morpho, Aave, Compound, Euler, and Unitus — ensuring security and transparency.

To protect withdrawals, Maxshot maintains an **idle liquidity buffer**:

- A small portion of funds is kept outside of lending markets.
- This ensures that most withdrawals can be processed **instantly**, even during high demand.

Funds flow dynamically across chains and protocols, always aiming for the **best balance of yield, liquidity, and safety.**

## Yield Strategies

### **Strategy Types**

Maxshot employs adaptive, AI-driven strategies designed to balance yield, liquidity, and risk. Instead of relying on static allocations, strategies are continuously optimized by the **Decision-Maker AI agent**, ensuring deposits are always working in the most productive positions. Each strategy type reflects a different balance between performance, safety, and flexibility—giving users a clear understanding of how their assets are managed.

| **Mode** | **Goal** | **How It Works** | **Profile** | **Best For** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Best Yield Mode** | Maximize APY at all costs | - Continuously chases the highest yield across whitelisted markets.

- Rebalances frequently based on events and automation triggers. | - Yield: Highest
- Liquidity: Low
- Risk: Higher
- Gas Cost: Higher  | Advanced users prioritizing returns over liquidity. |
| **Neutral Optimized Mode** | Balance yield, liquidity, and safety | - Uses a scoring model to rank markets by yield, liquidity, risk, and costs.

- Allocates funds in a **diversified and buffered** manner. | - Yield: Moderate
- Liquidity: High
- Risk: Low
- Gas Cost: Low | Most users — optimized for both stability and convenience. |

---

### **How Strategies Are Selected**

Instead of locking users into a fixed strategy, Maxshot employs a **Decision-Maker AI agent** that continuously adapts to market conditions, ensuring allocations are always optimized.

- Users do not need to pick a strategy — the **Decision-Maker AI agent** dynamically adjusts allocations.
- Strategies can shift automatically when markets change.

---

### **Why AI-Driven Strategies Matter**

Humans sleep. AI doesn’t. With **always-on intelligence**, Maxshot monitors every chain, reacts instantly, and compounds continuously — so your money never stops working.

| **Aspect** | **Human-Managed Funds** | **Maxshot-Managed Funds** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Operation** | Slow, manual, and limited by human oversight | Always-on autopilot — 24/7 monitoring across chains with real-time intelligence |
| **Efficiency** | Dependent on availability and reaction speed | High — continuous monitoring and instant execution |
| **Risk** | Higher chance of delays and costly errors | Reduced risk through automation, faster reactions, and data-driven decisions |

## **Fees & Rewards**

Fees and rewards are handled **fairly and transparently**, making it easy for users to understand exactly how their earnings grow.

| **Mechanism** | **How It Works** | **Key Benefit** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Performance Fee** | Applied **only on profits**, never on initial deposits. Configurable by governance (can be set to **0%**). | Users **only pay when they earn**; fair and transparent. |
| **Rewards Distribution** | Protocol collects yields from underlying markets and distributes them **proportionally to all share holders** via share token value. | Rewards are **automatic, proportional, and seamless**. |
| **Idle Buffer** | A small portion of deposits held in reserve to support instant withdrawals, even during high demand. | **Improves liquidity & user experience** while slightly reducing overall yield. |

## **Integrations**

Maxshot is built for **seamless integration and accessibility**. Developers and third-party platforms can embed its functionality directly into apps, wallets, and AI portals, while users enjoy **one-click access** to vaults across multiple interfaces — ensuring a consistent, frictionless experience.

- **SDKs and Widgets:** Developers can embed protocol functionality into apps, wallets, and dashboards with a single click.
- **AI Portal Integration:** Third-party platforms can incorporate the protocol’s features into their own AI assistants (e.g., wallet chatbots with built-in yield optimization).
- **One-Click Deployment:** Users interacting via different AI portals (Telegram bots, browser wallets, etc.) can access the same vault seamlessly.

# Vaults

## Morpho

Maxshot AI was first deployed on Morpho to autonomously manage multiple dForce vaults across different chains, demonstrating the power of AI-driven yield optimization in a live DeFi environment.

Maxshot AI’s integration with Morpho represents just the first step in dForce’s broader vision for autonomous, AI-powered DeFi. Looking ahead, we plan to expand vault offerings and strategies across additional chains and platforms, while continuously refining Maxshot AI’s algorithms based on evolving market conditions. We are also open to supporting new asset markets and exploring innovative ways AI agents can enhance user experience, optimize returns, and maintain robust risk management.

Beyond technical expansion, we aim to foster active collaboration with the Morpho community - helping to attract more users and TVL, while ensuring a safe, efficient, and optimized yield experience for all participants. Maxshot AI is built to adapt, scale, and act as a reliable partner, supporting the growth and innovation of the broader DeFi ecosystem for platforms like Morpho.

### Workflow

Maxshot’s *hybrid architecture* combines on-chain smart contracts with off-chain AI agent workflows to manage vaults efficiently and safely. On Morpho, Maxshot **dynamically allocates deposits across different lending markets** based on real-time conditions – all without manual control. Here’s an overview of how Maxshot operates and allocates capital on Morpho:

- **Continuous Monitoring**
    
    Maxshot AI’s agents track Morpho markets in real time—interest rates, liquidity, utilization, and caps—along with off-chain signals to react instantly to changes.
    
- **Decision-Maker Agent**
    
    At the core, a Decision-Maker agent runs simulations and risk checks to determine the optimal allocation of vault assets across Morpho lending pools.
    
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**
    
    When yields shift or risks emerge, Maxshot AI automatically reallocates deposits between markets if the benefit outweighs gas costs, keeping vaults efficient and balanced.
    
- **Safety Guardrails**
    
    Strict guardrails enforce ~95% utilization caps to preserve liquidity buffers, plus adaptive exposure limits to reduce allocations if liquidity or borrower health deteriorates.
    
- **Market Screening**
    
    Funds are only deployed to whitelisted, vetted markets. New opportunities are added only after passing rigorous safety and liquidity checks, preventing exposure to high-risk pools.
    

Through this systematic, data-driven process, Maxshot keeps vault deposits **always working in the most productive, yet risk-adjusted positions** on Morpho. It’s like having an expert fund manager on autopilot, ensuring users get great yields without the headache of constant manual management.

# Architecture

## **Unified DeFi Layer**

### **A Unified Foundation for Next-Generation DeFi**

Maxshot combines an **AI Agent Engine** with a **Multi-Chain Interaction Layer** to form a fully autonomous, omni-chain DeFi operating system. The AI engine continuously optimizes strategies and manages risk, while the multi-chain layer enables seamless deposits, withdrawals, and allocations across blockchains. Together, they deliver scalable, adaptive, and transparent protocols—vaults, DEXs, and lending—without the need for manual intervention.

The future of DeFi requires two essential building blocks:

1. **An intelligent brain** that makes real-time, data-driven decisions.
2. **A flexible body** that moves effortlessly across multiple blockchains as if they were one.

Maxshot unites these into a single reusable foundation: the **AI Agent Engine** (the brain) and the **Multi-Chain Interaction Layer** (the body). The result is a **DeFi Operating System** that any protocol can build upon—whether for yield vaults, decentralized exchanges, or lending platforms.

## **AI Agent Engine – The Brain**

Traditional DeFi often relies on custom bots or rigid smart contracts built for a single protocol, which are expensive to maintain and slow to adapt. Maxshot takes a different path by introducing a **general-purpose AI Agent Engine** — a modular intelligence layer that continuously manages strategies, optimizations, and risk across protocols and chains.

![AI Agent Engine Structure.png](Maxshot%20AI%20Docs%20-%202025%208%2024f4e4a8f064805e804feace1b14cf46/AI_Agent_Engine_Structure.png)

### **Core Design**

- **Agent Specialization**
    
    Each agent has a distinct role, working together like neurons in a brain:
    
    | **Agent** | **Role / Function** |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Collector Agent** | Aggregates data on APYs, liquidity, risk, and costs from various markets. |
    | **Decision-Maker Agent** | Formulates yield and liquidity strategies, optimizing allocations. |
    | **Executor Agent** | Executes on-chain actions, such as market deposits, withdrawals, or cross-chain transfers. |
    | **AI Assistant Agent** | Provides user support, facilitates deposits via SDK/widgets, and enables third-party integrations. |
    | **Keeper Agent** | Monitors protocol health, issues alerts, and triggers emergency actions when needed. |
- **LLM-Agnostic Architecture**
    - Compatible with **any large language model** (OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source).
    - **Future-proof** — no reliance on a single vendor.
- **Third-Party Integration**
    - **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Brings in external intelligence directly into decision loops.
    - **Wallets:** Native integrations for smooth user interactions.
    - **Security Tools:** Automated monitoring, anomaly detection, and rapid emergency response.
- **Composable by Design**
    - Agents can be **orchestrated in different combinations** depending on protocol type (vaults, DEXs, lending, insurance).
- **Fully Automated**
    - Strategies evolve in real time **without human intervention**, delivering 24/7 optimization.
- **Developer Leverage**
    - AI agents assist in **simulation, testing, and deployment**, accelerating protocol development and iteration cycles.

### **Why It Matters**

- **Reusable Intelligence Layer:** One engine powers many protocols — no need to reinvent the wheel.
- **Adaptive & Scalable:** Strategies shift dynamically as market conditions change, avoiding governance bottlenecks.
- **Accelerated Innovation:** Teams can launch and iterate on DeFi products faster by building on a shared AI intelligence foundation.
- **Trust & Resilience:** Continuous monitoring ensures both **user safety** and **protocol longevity**.

## **Multi-Chain Interaction Layer – The Body**

If the AI Agent Engine is the **brain**, then the **Multi-Chain Interaction Layer** is the **body** — executing decisions across blockchains with precision and speed. While users may only interact with the protocol from their preferred chain, the multi-chain layer ensures that every deposit, withdrawal, and allocation stays perfectly synchronized in the background.

![Multi-Chain Interaction Solution.png](Maxshot%20AI%20Docs%20-%202025%208%2024f4e4a8f064805e804feace1b14cf46/Multi-Chain_Interaction_Solution.png)

This design abstracts away the fragmentation of today’s DeFi, making multi-chain operations feel as seamless as using a single blockchain.

---

### **State Synchronization**

At the core is the challenge of maintaining a **single source of truth** across chains. Maxshot addresses this with a layered synchronization model:

- **Unified Ledger**
    - A dedicated ledger chain acts as the **global record keeper**.
    - Every deposit, withdrawal, swap, or loan is reconciled against this single state.
    - Eliminates conflicts and ensures **consistent accounting** across ecosystems.
- **On-Chain Synchronization**
    - Each chain pushes its state directly to the **Unified Ledger**.
    - Provides maximum transparency and trust-minimized security.
    - Tradeoff: higher cost and slower execution due to cross-chain transactions.
- **Hybrid Synchronization**
    - AI agents aggregate chain states off-chain and then submit **cryptographic proofs** to the Unified Ledger.
    - Faster, cheaper, and more scalable while maintaining verifiable trust.
    - Ideal for high-frequency actions like vault rebalancing.

---

### **Inter-Chain Messaging**

Smooth coordination requires **robust communication** between chains. The interaction layer is designed with flexibility to integrate best-in-class messaging solutions:

- **Selection Criteria:**
    - Security assumptions: fully trustless vs. semi-trusted relays.
    - Coverage: which L1s and L2s are supported.
    - Performance: balancing speed, gas cost, and reliability.
    - Resilience: guarantees of recovery if the messaging layer is compromised.
- **Risks & Mitigations:**
    - **Risk:** Malicious or delayed messages could lead to desync or exploits.
    - **Mitigation:** Guardian vetoes, time-locked execution windows, and **proof-of-state validation** safeguard the system.

---

### **Why It Matters**

The Multi-Chain Interaction Layer turns multi-chain DeFi from a patchwork into a **native feature**:

- **Chain-Agnostic User Experience**
    
    Deposit on Arbitrum, withdraw on Optimism, borrow on BNB Chain, repay on Ethereum — all with one account, one vault, one experience.
    
- **Extensible Beyond Vaults**
    - **Multi-chain DEX:** Liquidity pools and swaps are fungible across chains.
    - **Multi-chain Lending:** Collateral deposited on one chain can instantly back loans on another.
    - **Multi-chain Derivatives:** Pricing and hedging strategies operate on global liquidity, not isolated silos.
- **Born Multi-Chain, Not Bolted On**
    
    Instead of protocols adding bridges later as an afterthought, Maxshot protocols are **multi-chain by default**, removing friction and unlocking interoperability from day one.
    

---

This way, the **AI brain** makes smart decisions while the **multi-chain body** ensures those decisions can be executed anywhere — securely, instantly, and transparently.

## **Combined Vision – DeFi Operating System**

By uniting the **AI Agent Engine (brain)** with the **Multi-Chain Interaction Layer (body)**, Maxshot establishes a **general-purpose DeFi Operating System** — an intelligent and interoperable foundation that any protocol can build on.

![Combined Vision: AI-Native Multi-Chain DeFi Engine.png](Maxshot%20AI%20Docs%20-%202025%208%2024f4e4a8f064805e804feace1b14cf46/Combined_Vision_AI-Native_Multi-Chain_DeFi_Engine.png)

This OS transforms how decentralized finance is designed, deployed, and scaled:

- **Autonomous Yield Vaults**
    
    Vaults that **continuously optimize returns** across protocols and chains — no human oversight required.
    
- **Global Liquidity DEXs**
    
    Imagine a Uniswap-style exchange where liquidity isn’t siloed per chain but is instead **pooled globally**, making swaps more efficient and markets deeper.
    
- **Omni-Chain Lending & Borrowing**
    
    Collateral deposited on Ethereum can instantly back loans on Arbitrum or Optimism, **unlocking capital efficiency** across the entire DeFi landscape.
    
- **Composable Extensions**
    
    The same infrastructure can power **derivatives, RWA tokenization, or stablecoin systems** — all benefiting from AI-driven automation and seamless multi-chain execution.
    

---

### **Why This Matters**

The DeFi Operating System represents a shift from fragmented, chain-specific protocols to a **unified, intelligent fabric** for finance:

- **AI as the Brain →** Provides real-time intelligence, risk management, and adaptive strategies.
- **Multi-Chain as the Body →** Delivers interoperability, scalability, and chain-agnostic execution.

Together, they unlock **AI-native, chain-agnostic DeFi protocols** that are:

- **Scalable by design** — ready to handle growth without bottlenecks.
- **Adaptive by nature** — evolving automatically as markets change.
- **Composable by default** — enabling faster innovation and integration.

---

**In essence:** Maxshot doesn’t just build vaults, DEXs, or lending markets. It builds the **operating system for autonomous, omni-chain finance** — a foundation on which the next generation of DeFi will run.

# Security

## Key Roles

Even though Maxshot is autonomous, we have robust governance and safety measures in place to protect users. The system is overseen by multiple roles (with human and automated agents) and layered security mechanisms to ensure **transparency, security, and resiliency**:

- **Curator:** This is the role we seek for Maxshot on Morpho. The Curator sets the high-level vault parameters (e.g. which markets are whitelisted for that vault, performance fee structure, etc.) and oversees strategy governance. In essence, the Curator is responsible for the vault’s strategy and risk management. In Maxshot’s case, the *Curator is an automated agent* (with dForce team oversight) that ensures policies are followed and can adjust parameters via governance.
- **Guardian:** The Guardian acts as an emergency stop and monitor. They (or their automated Keeper Agent) co-sign critical transactions and can **veto or pause** actions if something seems off. For Maxshot, the Guardian layer adds a human-in-the-loop safety net – for example, pausing all vault operations if an exploit or abnormal behavior is detected.
- **Allocator:** This is the executer role that interfaces directly with Morpho’s smart contracts. The Allocator agent carries out the actual deposits, withdrawals, and rebalancing transactions according to the strategy the Decision-Maker (Curator) decides. Think of it as the hands of the system, where the Curator is the brain.

## Challenges & Solutions

Managing an omni-chain DeFi protocol comes with unique technical and operational challenges. Maxshot addresses these with a hybrid architecture that combines on-chain security with off-chain efficiency, ensuring real-time tracking, fair reward distribution, and protection against market or system risks.

| **Challenge** | **Solution** |
| --- | --- |
| **Real-Time Asset Tracking** | **On-Chain:** Epoch-based syncing via LayerZero ensures security, though it can be costly.

**Off-Chain:** Agent-driven queries provide cost-effective, real-time tracking with consensus verification. |
| **Exchange Rate Drawdown** | Strictly prohibited; mitigated through fees, insurance, and liquidation mechanisms to protect user funds. |
| **Reward Distribution** | Yields collected from underlying markets are distributed proportionally to all share holders, with verifiable state proofs for transparency. |

## Trust & Safeguards

**Timed Execution with Guardian Veto**

For any on-chain strategy actions that are potentially risky (like large rebalances or cross-chain transfers), Maxshot uses a time-lock delay. This means when the Allocator triggers such an action, it doesn’t execute immediately – there’s a delay (a “gray period”) during which Guardians and the community can see the pending action. If something looks harmful, the Guardian can veto/cancel the action within this window. This provides transparency and a chance to intervene before execution.

**Transparency & Proof of State**

All of Maxshot’s operations maintain proof-of-state across chains. That means vault balances, deposits, yields earned, and overall allocations are continuously recorded and can be verified by anyone. Users and community members can always audit the vault’s current state and historical performance on-chain. This level of transparency is key to building trust – even though AI agents are managing funds, everything they do is observable and auditable.

These governance layers and safeguards ensure that while Maxshot runs on auto-pilot, it remains under vigilant oversight and control. Users can trust that there are multiple lines of defense protecting their assets, from smart contract checks to human guardians ready to step in if needed.
